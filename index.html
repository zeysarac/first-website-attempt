        That's why I build this website. <br />
        <br />
        What did you think? I want to learn JavaScript therefore I've started
        learning HTML and CSS first and this website is for an assignment that
        was given to me?
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p class="parag">Pfft, you're funny.</p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p class="parag">Anyway.</p>

      <p class="parag">
        Since we are on the same page, now I will explain to you the things
        you'll see on the next pages and what are they for. Well, actually, I
        already mentioned it earlier but basically this site exists to save you
        from boredom to an extent and you'll see different ways to do so.
