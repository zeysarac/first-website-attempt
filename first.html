        First, I want you to lay down on the floor for a couple minutes.

      <p class="parag2">
        Stare the ceiling, think, sing if you want! Even if you don't fan of
        your voice, it comes a little bit different while lying on the floor or
        lying upside down in the bed. - I'm not sure what can happen bad but
        still be careful. No responsibility is taken for anything that may
        occur.- You can give it as shot and still you might not like it but
        don't worry because now you are not singing on your feet like a normal
        human being so the voice comes out from you is not your real voice.</p>
        <br />
        <p>By the way, there are some rules. You should't go on your phone and try
        not to sleep, please!</p>
        <br />
        <p>Thank you.
